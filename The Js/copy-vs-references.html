    let age = 100
    let age2 = age
    console.log(age, age2)
    age = 200
    console.log(age, age2)
    //answer 200, 100

    let name = 'max'
    let name2 = name
    console.log(name, name2)
    name = 'maxwell'
    console.log(name, name2)
    //answer maxwell, max

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players

    console.log(players, team)
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    team[3] = 'lux'

    console.log(team)
    //answer (4) ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "lux"]
    console.log(players)
      //answer (4) ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "lux"]

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2= players.slice()

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]

    const team5 = Array.from(players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 })
    console.log(cap2)

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const cap3 = {...person}

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
